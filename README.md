Hi there, I'm Lukas Reinhardt! 👋

With a background in sports medical engineering, where I gained extensive 
technical knowledge alongside medical topics, I've ventured into the world 
of software development. My focus is on product development—from CAD design 
to software programming and validation. I appreciate both the technical 
depth and the interdisciplinary collaboration that come with this field.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack
Currently, I'm working with Python and building a solid foundation in 
Java. Throughout my studies and various internships, I gained experience 
in languages like C++, MATLAB, and LabVIEW. I’m continuously learning and 
expanding my skills, enjoying a self-driven approach to mastering new 
technologies.

📈 My Journey
Starting from special needs education, I advanced through my studies 
to my current passion for software development—a path that required 
perseverance and adaptability. I gained hands-on experience with 
projects at ZF in electrical engineering and in the state construction 
agency, as well as my recent role at Schyns Medizintechnik.

🌱 Current Projects
Alongside finishing a Python book, I’m planning to release educational 
videos that cover foundational topics in back-end and front-end programming. 
My goal is to develop a warehouse management system and make this knowledge 
accessible to beginners.

💼 Interests & Goals
I aim to establish myself long-term in software development, and I currently 
see myself at a junior developer level. I’m passionate about both the project 
management and technical depth of software engineering, and I’m always open to 
new challenges and collaborations.
