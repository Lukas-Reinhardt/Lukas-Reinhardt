👋 Hi, I’m Lukas Reinhardt,

a tech enthusiast and aspiring software developer with a background in sports medical engineering. Currently, I’m focused on backend and frontend development using Python, and I’m planning to showcase several projects here soon.

🔍 What you can expect:

- Software projects featuring database (SQL) and UI design, 
- Custom applications and tools for process optimization,
- Learning resources and code snippets for beginners

💡 I’m a quick learner and will be expanding my skills to include Java soon.

Feel free to take a look and leave feedback!
